•How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by approaching the process methodically. We begin with the use of proper naming, in order to keep everything consistent throughout the work. We use proper exception handling, in order to make sure that we know exactly what went wrong when running our program. We also use proper class organization and commenting so that our code can be looked at and utilized at later dates. Lastly, we use the single responsibility principle, implementing and creating methods meant to do very specific things so that we can use them in place of doing those specific things over and over again. This was relevant in the dashboard widgets as we implemented almost all of these rules throughout the process.

•How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I approach a problem as a computer scientist in the way that I think any scientist approaches a problem. You create a hypothesis, or a method that you think may be successful, and you test and implement until you eventually reach a place where the product succeeds or fails. If it fails, you start over and try again until you reach success. In the future I would study the approach of the currently existing database structure and internally work it out so that I can find places where improvements can be made in meeting the requests. 


•What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer scientists figure out solutions to the problems plaguing the world of computer science, whether it be small incremental improvements for a large corporation or in the pursuit of something completely new. The work matters because it makes the world, as it is today, exist in the fashion that it does. Computer science is the future, and will only grow in its scope, human led or not. This type of work would only serve to help a corporation like Grazioso Salvare grow, expanding their services and possibly making the user experience significantly better.
